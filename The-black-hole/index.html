                <ul>
                    <li>Calm Pupu: if you don't bother Pupu, it will stay calm and enjoy the starry dust around it.</li>
                    <li>A little angry Pupu: if you keep on bothering Pupu, it'll get slightly angry and send gravitational
                         waves that change the color of the starry dust beside it.</li>
                    <li>Erupting Pupu: Pupu get truly angry after continuous botherings, it will erupt and unleash emotional
                         particles.  </li>

                Pupu is a unique and special black hole that belongs to a family known as Emotigravidae (the "emotional
                 gravity family"). Unlike normal black holes, Pupu is alive with emotions and interacts with its 
                 surroundings based on how it feels. Pupu feeds on emotional resonance particles that stabilize its 
                 feelings.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Carefully touch this 
                creature and you'll see the gravitational waves; Try harder you'll see its' emotional changes; Be careful
                not to touch it too many times or it will erupt!(You'll regret it!)
